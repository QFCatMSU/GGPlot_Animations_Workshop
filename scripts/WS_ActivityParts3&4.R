  # This time, weâ€™ll be using the larval white sucker data. Subset the data set 
  # from April to September. Plot month vs zooplankton and larval white sucker 
  # abundance, and create a separate plot for each year by faceting. Add a second 
  # axis for the white sucker abundance (you will need to calculate a new scaling 
  # coefficient here, using the same method that was used to calculate the scaling 
  # coefficient for the larval white bass data). Change the color of the 
  # lines and the theme of the plot as you see fit, making sure to reflect this in 
  # the legend.

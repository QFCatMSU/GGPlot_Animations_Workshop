  # This time, weâ€™ll be using the larval white sucker data. 
  #
  #   (1) Subset the data set from April to September.
  #
  #   (2) Plot month vs zooplankton and larval white sucker abundance.
  #
  #   (3) Create a separate plot for each year by faceting.
  #
  #   (4) Add a second axis for the white sucker abundance; you will need 
  #       to calculate a new scaling coefficient here, using the same method 
  #       that was used to calculate the scaling coefficient for the larval 
  #       white bass data. 
  #
  #   (5) Change the color of the lines and the theme of the plot as you see 
  #       fit, making sure to reflect this in the legend.

  # This time, weâ€™ll be using the larval white sucker data. 
  #
  #   (1) Subset the data set from March to October for the year 2010.
  #
  #   (2) Pick and implement one of the two methods labeling months on the x axis
  #
  #   (2) Map the larval white bass abundance to the y-axis instead of zooplankton abundance.
  #
  #   (3) Make it a line plot, and use a blue, dashed line (or non-default linetype).
  #
  #   (4) Select a theme for your plot that is different from the default 
  #
  #   (5) Label and sublabel your plots to match the data plotted 
  
  
  # subset data and color is used as a style change here -- it is not mapped to data
